/*
 * CC200 Assignment
 *
 * Author: Mike Aldred
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   This is where the majority of the hard work is done. As per the
 *   assignment specs, this impliments a stop and wait protocol.
 *   Additionally, each link on a node has a boundless queue, this
 *   means that any new packets will be queued if the node is waiting
 *   for an ACK to be received.
 *
 *   This was done to remove the need to have
 *   CNET_(enable/disable)_application function calls. This
 *   implimentation supports all node applications generating messages
 *   fulltime. However, given the efficiency of the stop and wait
 *   protocol, these queues will keep growing. Since CNET runs for 5
 *   minutes only as a default, this shouldn't be a problem.

 * link is waiting on an ACK, if it isn't, then send off the first
 * packet in the queue.
 *

/*
 * Timeouts
 *
 * A timer is set to go off if we don't receive an ACK from a node. If
 * the timer is fired, then the frame needs to be resent on the link
 * again, and the timer is set again.
 *
 * This will keep happening until it works, or the zombie apocalypse.
